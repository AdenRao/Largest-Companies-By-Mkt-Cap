          <p>Hi, my name is Aden Rao and I am the maker of this website. I am 15 years olds and a programmer, wantrepreneur and an investor in companies like Uber Technologies, Inc. I made this website to make a clean and simple list of the largest public companies by market cap. I thought of doing this website when I saw a website that did this exact thing but it was really garbage looking and with this website the market cap's update every single hour but when the markets are closed it updates once post market and another pre market. So hopefully you enjoy this website and if you have any suggestions or problems with the website then go to the contact tab and email me.</p>
